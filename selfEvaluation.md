# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

Not awesome. This took me probably 5-6 hours of fumbling in total. I'm starting to figure it out, but it seems like it's a lot of googling and praying to find some specific method and I haven't figured out how to do that reliably.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

A lot of unproductive struggle, googling things that went nowhere. I finally worked through some patterns and figured out how to generally apply the logic, but I still don't have a useful vocabulary of methods nor a reliable way to find them. I hope I'm using the word "methods"n right. I mean things like words[i].length to find the character count of a word. How do you find that sort of information efficiently?

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

Could use some more googling practice maybe?

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

For methods such as words[i].length to find the character count of a word, how do you find that sort of information efficiently?
